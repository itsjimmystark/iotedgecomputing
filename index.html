<h2> <a href="https://alex-payne1.gitlab.io/techtobard/">How Edge Computing Reduces Latency in Industrial Automation Systems</a></h2>
    
<h2>What is IoT?</h2>
<p><strong>Definition of IoT</strong></p>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data over the internet. These devices can range from everyday household items to sophisticated industrial machinery.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of IoT</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> IoT devices are connected to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data.</li>
  <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Many IoT applications enable automated processes without human intervention.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> IoT devices continuously collect data, providing valuable insights for analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Edge Computing?</h2>
<p><strong>Definition of Edge Computing</strong>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed. This reduces latency and bandwidth usage by processing data near its source rather than relying solely on centralized cloud servers.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of Edge Computing</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced Latency:</strong> Processing data at the edge minimizes delays, enhancing real-time decision-making.</li>
  <li><strong>Bandwidth Efficiency:</strong> By filtering and processing data locally, edge computing reduces the amount of data transmitted to the cloud.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Local processing can mitigate some security risks associated with sending sensitive data over the internet.</li>
</ul>
